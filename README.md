# GSS-Addiction-Perception-Analysis

# Multinomial regression on GSS data to model public views on addiction and their demographic and political predictors.

This project explores how public attitudes toward drug addiction—as a disease or a moral failing—relate to demographic factors and political affiliation using the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset. The goal is to generate actionable insights for improving healthcare communication and public health policy.

## 📊 Key Findings
- People with higher education are **74% more likely** to view addiction as a disease.
- Older respondents tend to avoid extreme views on addiction, suggesting a nuanced audience.
- These insights can inform more targeted messaging for addiction awareness campaigns.
